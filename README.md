# Algorithms-DataStructures
This is a repository to store all of my work from studying algorithms and data structures.
Below you will find a list of problems I have solved for practice from either LeetCode or online classes.

# Standford University's alogorithms specialization

**Week One - Karatsuba.py**
this first assignment asks to find the product of two 64-digit numbers using Karatsuba's Algorithm.

**Week Two - IntegerArray.py**
this assignment provides a IntegerArray.txt file with 100,000 integers between 1 - 100,000 with none repeating. The assignment asks to find the number of inversions in the file.

# LeetCode

**Valid Anagram.py**
this problem asks given two string s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s
