# Algorithms-DataStructures
This is a repository to store all of my work from studying algorithms and data structures. 
Below you will find classes and the problems solved in that class.

# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
This is the first class within the Algorithms specialization offered by Standford University online.

**Week One - Karatsuba.py**

This first assignment asks to find the product of two 64-digit numbers using Karatsuba's Algorithm.

**Week Two - IntegerArray.py**

This assignment provides a IntegerArray.txt file with 100,000 integers between 1 - 100,000 with none repeating. The assignment asks to find the number of inversions in the file.
